# Ambient lighting with RGB LED strip and Arduino
Having made the [3x3x3 LED cube](), I wanted to further play with RGB LEDs instead of single colored LEDs and even more visually appealing. 
So, I built the hardware circuit and implemented the code as given in- https://medium.com/@rjrshr/arduino-based-pc-ambient-lighting-bb370b0b64f1 to
make the RGB LED strip glow with the average color of all the pixels of my laptop display. 
To test the project code, Coldplay music videos were used they are some of the most colorful and have similar color shades in a particular frame which makes the output on the LED strip look quite stunning.

The output is as seen below-
